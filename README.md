## Harper Overview

Harper eliminates the complexity typically synonymous with distributed services by combining an ultra-fast document data store, in-memory cache, real-time message broker, and your application components into a single distributed technology. When clustered and geo-distributed, Harper nodes instantly synchronize data creating a real-time service fabric, ensuring low-latency in-region responses for clients worldwide. In addition to massive cost savings at scale, Harper’s REST, GraphQL, SQL, and real-time interfaces make light work of servicing frontend requirements. Install and manage on your hardware with npm, or have us host your services with Harper Cloud. For questions, reach us at [hello@harperdb.io](mailto:hello@harperdb.io).

## Harper APIs

The preferred way to interact with Harper for typical querying, accessing, and updating data (CRUD) operations is through the REST interface, described in the REST documentation.

The complete [Harper Operations API documentation](https://docs.harperdb.io/docs/operations-api) provides important administrative functions. Generally it is recommended that use the [RESTful interface](https://docs.harperdb.io/docs/rest/) as your primary interface for scalable and performant data interaction for building production applications, and the operations API for administrative purposes.
